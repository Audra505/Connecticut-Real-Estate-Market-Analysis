Connecticut Real Estate Market Analysis (2012–2022)
1.Project Overview
This project explores Connecticut’s real estate market from 2012 to 2022 through an interactive Power BI dashboard. With over 500,000 records, the report analyzes town-level sales trends, seasonal patterns, and pricing behavior to uncover how the market responded to economic booms, busts, and structural challenges.
Built to support analysts, investors, and policymakers, the dashboard answers key questions:
Which towns led the boom years, and when did slowdowns emerge?
How did seasonality impact pricing and transaction volume?
What patterns defined resilient or vulnerable towns over time?

What I Did:
Cleaned and transformed a large dataset into usable insights
Created dynamic DAX measures and visuals
Designed responsive visuals with drilldowns, filters, tooltips, and storytelling elements
Balanced technical complexity with accessibility for broad audiences
