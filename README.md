Connecticut Real Estate Market Analysis (2012–2022)

1.Project Overview
This project explores Connecticut’s real estate market from 2012 to 2022 through an interactive Power BI dashboard. With over 500,000 records, the report analyzes town-level sales trends, seasonal patterns, and pricing behavior to uncover how the market responded to economic booms, busts, and structural challenges.
Built to support analysts, investors, and policymakers, the dashboard answers key questions:
Which towns led the boom years, and when did slowdowns emerge?
How did seasonality impact pricing and transaction volume?
What patterns defined resilient or vulnerable towns over time?

What I Did:
Cleaned and transformed a large dataset into usable insights
Created dynamic DAX measures and visuals
Designed responsive visuals with drilldowns, filters, tooltips, and storytelling elements
Balanced technical complexity with accessibility for broad audiences

Outcome:
A clean, actionable dashboard that helps users navigate local housing trends, uncover hidden patterns, and make informed decisions.

Connecticut’s boom years 2013, 2015, 2020, and 2021 were marked by strong buyer confidence, low interest rates, and a drive for space and stability. From post-recession rebounds to the pandemic surge, suburban towns like Stamford, Greenwich, and Danbury consistently led the charge. Sales and transactions spiked, with single-family homes remaining the preferred choice. Together, these years revealed the market’s capacity for rapid growth when economic conditions align with evolving lifestyle needs.

Connecticut’s bust years 2016, 2018, and 2022 exposed the market’s limits amid economic pressure, rising rates, and affordability challenges. Each downturn revealed how even resilient towns falter when price growth outpaces income and inventory shrinks. Smaller towns like Plainville and Union were hit hardest, with months of little to no activity, exposing their fragility in a shifting market. While demand for housing remained, it couldn’t overcome structural constraints and shifting policies.These years show that sustained real estate growth depends not just on demand, but on access, affordability, and balanced supply.

Connecticut’s real estate market followed a strong seasonal pattern—surging in summer and slowing in winter with nearly one-third of sales occurring between May-August. Pandemic years amplified this trend, with towns like Stamford even recording December highs tied to luxury and relocation activity. By 2022, that momentum weakened summer peaks softened and smaller towns like Plainville and Union saw erratic or no activity. These shifts revealed how buyer behavior, affordability, and local market strength shape and disrupt seasonality over time.
